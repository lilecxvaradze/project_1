            <br>

            <p>The Battle of Didgori was fought between the armies of the Kingdom of Georgia and the Seljuk Empire at the narrow place of Didgori, <br> 40 km west of Tbilisi, on August 12, 1121. The large Muslim army, under the command of Ilghazi,was unable to maneuver<br>and suffered a devastating defeat due to King David IV's effective military tactics.</p>

            <p>The battle at Didgori was the culmination of the entire Georgian–Seljuk wars and led to the Georgians' reconquest of Tbilisi in 1122.<br> Soon after that David moved the capital from Kutaisi to Tbilisi. The victory at Didgori inaugurated the medieval Georgian Golden Age<br>and is celebrated in The Georgian Chronicles as Modern Georgians continue to remember the event as an annual August 12 festival<br> known as Didgoroba ("[the day] of Didgori").</p>

            <p style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>The Muslim coalition</strong></p>

        <main>
            <p>Both Georgian and Islamic sources testify that on the complaints of the Muslim merchants of – Tbilisi, Ganja and Dmanisi – <br>Sultan Mahmud II of Baghdad (r. 1118–1131) sent an expedition into Georgia under command of Ilghazi ibn Artuq of Mardin,<br>whose hegemony in the Middle East and authority among the Muslims was indisputable. After pillaging the County of Edessa<br> and defeat of Roger of Antioch at the battle of Ager Sanguinis in 1119, the reputation of Ilghazi as a great military commander<br>and champion of Muslims against Christians spread far and wide.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After this victory Ilghazi made a truce with the Crusaders and went north towards Armenia at the invitation of the sultan's brother<br> Toghrul, ruler of Arran. There he joined a Muslim coalition against Christian Georgians and lead the coalition's army, in which his<br> vassal Tughan-Arslan lord of Arzen, Bidlis and Dvin, the Mazyadid Dubays b. Sadaqa of Al Hillah, Toghrul and Nakhichevan,<br>with his atabeg Kun-Toghdi, all took part.</p>
            <br>
            <p>According to historian Alexander Mikaberidze, "The size of the Muslim army is still a matter of debate, with numbers ranging<br> from a fantastic 600,000 men (as given by Walter the Chancellor and Matthew of Edessa) to 400,000 (Sempad Sparapet's Chronicle),<br>while estimates of modern Georgian historians vary between 100,000 and 250,000 men. Although the higher numbers are exaggerated,<br>all sources indicate that the Muslims made massive preparations. In mid-summer 1121, the Muslim troops advanced along various routes,<br> with part of them passing the provinces of Erzerum and Kars, while Sultan Toghrul ibn Muhammad moved through Ganja and Tughan-Arslan<br> the "Hunchback" marched from Dvin.</p>
            <br>
            <p>According to Matthew of Edessa, the Muslim coalition numbered 560,000 men in total, led by Ilghazi with his vassal Tughan-Arslan,<br>and with support from nomadic Arab tribes.</p>

            <p>As the Georgian king was well aware of the coalition's plans, he decided to exclude one of the coalition leaders. In the first half of 1121,<br>the Georgians twice attacked the Seljuks in the territory of the Emirate of Ganja and massacred them. As a consequence, the ruler of Arran<br> was no longer able to participate in the campaign.</p>

           <p>On the other side, the Georgians were facing a significantly superior foe in terms of numbers, but had the strategic as well as tactical advantage.<br> The Georgians were well aware of the Muslim preparations and took necessary precautions. In 1118, after successful completion of David IV's <br>military reform, a royal guard and a household force known as 'mona-spa', a royal servant host made up of mercenaries and lower nobility <br>was formed. The Georgian army of 56,000 men included 500 Alans, about 200 Franks, and 15,000 Kipchaks.</p>

            <p>Georgian relations with Cumans-Kipchaks seem to have been generally peaceful. Moreover, the Georgian politicians of that time saw the Kipchaks as <br>potential allies against the Seljuk conquests. According to Georgian chronicles, Georgians knew about the Kipchaks' good fighting skills, their bravery,<br> and the enormous human resources that they had." After the victories of the Rus' Grand Prince Vladimir II Monomakh in 1109, 40,000 Kipchaks <br>commanded by Otrok Khan,known in Georgia as Atrak'a, son of Sharagan, fled to Georgia, received baptism, and entered the service of the Georgian<br> king David IV. The Georgian-Kipchak alliance was facilitated by David's earlier marriage to the Khan's daughter, who received the name Gurandukht. <br>Kipchaks were outfitted by the crown and were granted lands to settle. In turn, the Kipchaks provided one soldier per family, allowing King David to <br>establish a standing army in addition to his royal troops.</p>

            <p>The participation of Frankish soldiers in the battle of Didgori is reported in two sources: one by a 12th-century Armenian historian, Matthew of Edessa,<br> who mentions 100 Franks, and the other by Walter the Chancellor, according to whom David used 200 Frankish soldiers deployed ahead of his armies<br> as a striking force against the enemy.</p>

            <p>There is no exact information whether they were auxiliary troops sent by the prince of Antioch or king Baldwin II of Jerusalem,or simply mercenaries. <br>However, as both Franks and Georgians had one common enemy, the Muslims, it can be argued that the Frank soldiers were allies rather than mercenaries. <br>It's supposed that Crusaders arrived to Georgia through Constantinople because the territory between Antioch and Georgia was occupied by the Seljuks.</p>

            <p>King David could not allow Ilghazi to unite with the Tbilisi Muslims, so he decided to intercept him on his way there. He used a strategy of surprise and to entice<br> the enemy step-by-step into a trap. He chose a mountainous and wooded area near the Didgori Mountain range, situated between Manglisi and Tbilisi, to attack. <br>"On August 11, 1121, King David led his army along the Nichbisi valley from the ancient capital of Mtskheta and divided his troops into two parts, one under his<br> personal command and the other smaller group under his son Demetrius I, hidden in reserve behind the nearby heights with orders to attack the flank at a given signal."</p>
            <br>
            <p>The course of the battle is differently related in the contemporary historical records. According to the Arab chronicler Ibn al-Athir, David sent a small Kipchak<br> detachment of his men in order to simulate negotiation. The Muslims thought that the small detachment had left the Georgian army seeking protection,<br> so the Muslims did not regard them as a threat. Meanwhile, the Georgians successfully managed to deploy a large portion of their force where they would<br> almost encircle the enemy in a pincer movement. Their opponents remained unaware of such activities. Upon approaching the Seljuq leaders, the deserters,<br> using the self-confidence of the Muslims to their advantage, attacked them with arrows, killing every Seljuq commander in sight and others who were attending <br>the meeting.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While this was going on, David ordered a frontal attack on the enemy vanguard with his crusader knights which not only devastated the enemy's forward lines,<br> but also entangled the Seljuq archers in close combat, effectively taking out a crucial component of Ilghazi's force. This trick resulted in chaos and panic among<br> the Muslims. The Georgians then began to quickly advance on the flanks from the western side of the mountain in full formation. Ilghazi and his son-in-law both<br> survived the attack on the vanguard, but were severely injured during the fight and withdrew from the battlefield, leaving the Seljuq army virtually leaderless.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The majority of his commanders were either injured or killed, which caused confusion and probably resulted in a lack of adequate response to the chaotic situation.<br> King David didn't hesitate and personally led the Georgian right flank, ordering his heavy cavalry to ride straight into the seemingly disorganised Seljuk left flank,<br> which was trying to reinforce the vanguard. Having the advantage of moving downhill, the charge of the Georgian cavalry proved very effective.</p>

            <p>Almost simultaneously the left wing, under the command of David's son Demetrius, struck the Seljuk right flank also with heavy cavalry. When the Georgian infantry<br> joined the fight, the Seljuq troops started to panic and retreated en masse through the huge gap in their army's rearguard, which wasn't engaged in the battle. <br>This provoked large numbers of uninvolved Seljuq troops to flee as well, causing a massive rout, while their vanguard was completely annihilated. According to <br>a Georgian chronicler, King David’s troops pursued them for three days “putting all of them to the sword and leaving them to the carnivorous beasts and birds <br>of the mountains and plains” of the Manglisi Valley</p>
            <br>
            <p>"Terrible and savage slaughter of the enemy troops ensued and the [enemy] corpses filled up the rivers and covered all valleys and cliffs."</p>
            <br>
            <p>— Matthew of Edessa</p>
            <br>
            <p>With the Kipchaks joining in, the final remnants of Seljuq resistance crumbled and joined the rout. The battle was decided within three hours with the Seljuq<br> army overrun, leaving a very large number of dead, injured, prisoners, and booty. Fleeing remnants were constantly pursued and run down for several days<br> so that they wouldn't have time or opportunity to regroup or commence any other move.</p>

            <p>Aside from those accounts, it has also been suggested that confronted by a vanguard of the large invading force, David had to rely on the advantages the<br> nearby terrain offered to disguise his troop movements. The Seljuk cavalry was provoked or tricked into a relatively narrow pass where they probably had<br> not much room to maneuver. As these were cut off from the rest of Ilghazi's army, the Georgians were easily able to take them out with spears, pikes, and<br> light infantry using bows and javelins. The rest of the coalition army was probably forced to climb slopes to attack the Georgian army's main body, while <br>being constantly struck at the flanks by heavy cavalry. After a while, those tactics broke the fighting will of the Muslim army, which was soon routed.<br> Ilghazi reportedly received an injury to his head when a hundred crusaders managed to break through his lines, rushing towards the Seljuq <br>command banner.</p>
